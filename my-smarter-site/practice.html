    <h1>Learning</h1>
    <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p class="Georgia">This a multi-line paragraph where I am first starting out learning HTML and CSS, by reading and going through coding challenges here, as well as completing online exercises, in the <i>A Smarter Way to Learn HTML and CSS</i> book by Mark Myers. I think the short chapers, writing style, and coding practice works pretty well for me. After I'm done writing this paragraph I'm going to check to see how it looks in the browser. It turned out it wasn't really "multi-line," after all, so here's some more text. The right edges of this paragraph will be pretty ragged because it is not justified. And the first line, by default, is not indented.</p>
    <p class="important">Warning: we have no slow lorises here.</p>
    <h2 class="typewriter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>
    <p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also in typewriter text (and <span class="red">RED!</span>)</p>
    <h2 class="italic">Heading in Italics</h2>
    <p> Sample text with <i>i for italics</i>, text with <em>em for italics</em>, text with <b>b for bold</b> and, lastly, <strong>strong for bold</strong>. And also <span class="emphasized">span using "emphasized" class.</span></p>
    <p class="more-space">This paragraph should have extra space between the letters, even more space between the words, and should be approx. double-spaced, like you would do when writing a paper for school.</p>
    <h3>All H3 Headings Are Centered</h3>
    <p class="justify">This paragraph is justified so it's not ragged on the right edge anymore! But you wouldn't be able to tell with only one short sentence. There needs to be more text to stretch across the page and wrap to the next line to see the difference between text that is the default left-align, versus text where the "justify" class is specified. I remember learning about "justify" in my first Word Processing class in high school (10th grade, I believe). It turns out that was a good class to take, who knew? At the time, the Internet barely existed. I can't imagine being in high school now, with so much technology at your fingertips.</p>
    <p class="indent">Here's a paragraph that indents the first line. The second line, where the text has wrapped around, will be left-aligned. I just need to write enough text to make it wrap to a second line so that we can see the difference, that the first line is in fact indented, and that the second line is pushed all the way to the left. Did it work? Yes!</p>
    <blockquote><p>This is a paragraph inside blockquote tags, so this text should look like a quote from a book or a famous speech or something. I mean, it is pretty memorable and should definitely be taken as special and authoritative, to be quoted for years to come, by future generations. It probably won't be delivered in an address by a President to the nation, but, who knows? Maybe it will be delivered in an address by a software teacher to his beginner coding class. Queue: DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR. And enough text to make a blockquote. I hope.</p></blockquote>
    <p class="extra_whitespace">Here's a paragraph that has a 2em margin on all sides, adding extra whitespace to every side. You can also specify just one side that needs extra space, like margin-top. The best way to add extra space between paragraphs it to add it to margin-bottom. The default is 0, so anything more than that is extra. This paragraph is similar to the blockquote style, but the extra space I specified, 2em, looks to be a little less than the default extra space of the blockquote tag.</p>
    <h2 class="border">Heading: 5px Ridge Turquoise Padding</h2>
    <h4>H4 Heading Grouped with Paragraph; Both Are Centered</h4>
    <p class="center">This paragraph is grouped with the h4 heading above, and both are centered. P.S. It seems kind of weird that headings aren't automatically centered...</p>
    <h2 id="orange">Heading with ID #Orange</h2>
    <div id="special">
      <h2>Heading with Special ID</h2>
      <p>Both the heading above and this paragraph are children of a div with the ID, "special," since this is unique and will appear only once on this page. There are 3em margins on the left and right, and the font-family starts with Arial.... So.... why is this text serif and not Arial/sans-serif?? It does look like it has a right margin, though, so that's good. I tried a hard refresh, but that didn't work. I figured out that it was because I had specified above that all paragraphs would have the Georgia font. So I made that a class instead, which enabled this div inheritance to work. It still seems strange how the paragraph styling way up above overrode the div styling, though.</p>
